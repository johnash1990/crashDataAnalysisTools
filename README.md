## EXPLANATION OF LICENSE CHOICE:
For this project, we selected a BSD license as it is a common license for
scientific python (as noted in class). More specifically, it allows the
software to be used in private and commercial applications, as well as
allowing for the software to be distributed and modified (all of which we
the developers are okay with). Further, such a license does not require
that state changes to the code be indicated by users.
