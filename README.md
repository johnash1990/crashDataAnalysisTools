# crashDataAnalysisTools
Traffic crash data analysis tools for CSE 599 Final Project

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
- crashDataAnalysisTools: This directory will hold the code for the package
and has the same name as the repo in which it is held. It has been
initialized with an init file in order to make it into a python project.

- tests: This directory will hold the unit tests for the project. As was the
case above, the folder has been initialized with an init file.

- data: This directory will hold data needed for modeling tasks. As of now,
it only contains weather data.

## EXPLANATION OF LICENSE CHOICE:
For this project, we selected a BSD license as it is a common license for
scientific python (as noted in class). More specifically, it allows the
software to be used in private and commercial applications, as well as
allowing for the software to be distributed and modified (all of which we
the developers are okay with). Further, such a license does not require
that state changes to the code be indicated by users.
