# Crash Data Analysis Tool (CDAT) Design Manual

Vehicle accident is a world-wide problem that can transportation agencies are facing. Depending on the severity of the accident, it may result in property damage, personal injury or death. Traffic accidents are responsible for great social and economical costs and enormous efferts were made to reduce crash rates as well as to mitigate crash impacts.

A number of factors can contribute to the risk of vehicle crash, including vehicle design and operation status, traffic flow conditions, roadway design, and human factors. Previous studies have developed some general forms of crash model to help reveal the impact of some factors.

The objective of the research is to understand how on-road crash is related to different types of factors, including traffic flow parameters, roadway geometry, and weather conditions. In addressing the problem, three different data sources (HSIS, Freeway Elevation Dataset, Weather Data) are integrated containing those factors. Users can refer to the data description markdown file for more details about the datasets. Analysis of the datasets focusing on the several following tasks:

### Tasks
- Obtain crash data, road network data, elevation data and weather data and complie them together.

### Use Cases
- Draw a scatterplot of crash rate vs. factors such as speed, temperature, precipitation, etc.
